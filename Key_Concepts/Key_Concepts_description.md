<b>5th generation warfare:</b> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth-generation_warfare<br><br>
Fifth-generation warfare blends physical conflict with information and psychological tactics. It’s decentralized and targets perceptions over territory. The Wikipedia page frames it as modern warfare’s evolution. Non-state actors often drive it. Defending against it requires resilience in thought.<br>
<br><br>
<b>Titytainment:</b> http://www.gandalf.it/arianna/titty.htm<br><br>

<br><br>
<b>Problem-Reaction-Solution - PRS:</b> https://www.tanbou.com/2022/Noam-Chomsky-10-strategies-manipulation.htm<br><br><br>
This strategy, often linked to manipulation tactics, involves creating a problem to provoke a reaction from the public, then offering a pre-planned solution. It’s a method to control narratives and push agendas under the guise of necessity. The linked article attributes this to Noam Chomsky’s analysis of media and power. Governments or entities might use it to justify policies that would otherwise face resistance. It thrives on fear and urgency to bypass critical thinking.<br>
<br><br>
<b>Emotional Manipulation:</b> https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gamuchirai-chinamasa-3a0b93142_understand-emotional-manipulation-tactics-activity-7189487683012882432-S-rX<br><br>
Emotional manipulation exploits feelings to influence behavior or decisions, often subtly. It can involve guilt-tripping, flattery, or fear to sway individuals or groups.

<br><br>
<b>Data Voids:</b> https://datasociety.net/library/data-voids/<br><br>
Data voids occur when there’s a lack of credible information on a topic, leaving room for misinformation to fill the gap. Search engines amplify this by prioritizing available content, even if it’s dubious. The Data Society report explains how this can be exploited to mislead people. It’s a vulnerability in digital information ecosystems. Bad actors often target these gaps deliberately.<br>
<br><br>
<b>Audience Vulnerability:</b> https://github.com/DISARMFoundation/DISARMframeworks/blob/main/generated_pages/techniques/T0083.md<br><br>

<br><br>
<b>Confirmation Bias:</b> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VUCA<br><br>
Confirmation bias is the tendency to favor information that aligns with existing beliefs. It distorts perception and reinforces echo chambers.

<br><br>
<b>Anchor Bias:</b> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring_effect<br><br>
Anchor bias occurs when an initial piece of information unduly influences subsequent judgments. It’s widely used in pricing or negotiations. The Wikipedia article explains its cognitive roots. People often fail to adjust enough from the anchor. Critical analysis can reduce its sway.<br>
